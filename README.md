# Bootstrap Remix (Internship Task)

A 3-page Bootstrap 5 site built by remixing components (Navbar, Hero/Carousel, Cards, Modal, Forms).

## Tech
- HTML5, CSS3
- Bootstrap 5 via CDN
- Git & GitHub
- Hosted on GitHub Pages or Netlify (Netlify Forms enabled)

## Pages
- `index.html` — Navbar, Carousel hero, feature cards, modal, footer
- `about.html` — Cards, accordion FAQ, layout notes
- `contact.html` — Validated form (Netlify Forms compatible), info card

## How I built it (Reflection)
1. Browsed Bootstrap examples/components, noted patterns I liked.
2. Composed a clean navbar + hero carousel, then added feature cards with consistent spacing.
3. Built About (cards + accordion) to show component synergy and layout thinking.
4. Built Contact with client-side validation and Netlify Forms to make it “working” without backend.
5. Ensured responsiveness with container, grid, and utilities; polished spacing and typography.
6. Deployed to Netlify/GitHub Pages.

**Tools used:** Bootstrap docs/examples, ChatGPT for structuring & polish.  
**Challenges:** Balancing originality vs. examples; keeping spacing clean across breakpoints.  
**Solutions:** Utility classes (`pt-`, `pb-`, `g-`, `gap-`, `rounded-4`, `shadow-sm`) and minimal custom CSS.  
**Time taken:** _Fill your actual hours/days here honestly._

## Deploy

### GitHub Pages
